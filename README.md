# node-camera

> This rather complete Node wrapper for gphoto2_(required)_ enables you to list all compatible cameras and their 
abilities, setup camera parameters, capture images, bursts, timelapses and even video, if supported. 

## 1. Installation
### 1.1. Install prerequisities

As this package is a mere wrapper of the gphoto2's cli, you need to install that first:

#### a) MacOS
```
brew install gphoto2
```

#### b) Linux
```
sudo apt-get install gphoto2
```

#### c) Windows

Haven't tested it, so feel free to google instructions from somebody who has.

### 1.2. Install the npm package

After you have the dependencies installed, it's all easy-peasy lemon-squeezy from there:
```
yarn add node-camera
```

## 2. Getting started
